Net-OpenID-Consumer
===================
This is a set of Perl modules for implementing a Relying Party for
OpenID -- a distributed identity system based on proving you own a
URL, which then serves as an identity.

More information on OpenID itself is available at:

   http://openid.net

There are two companion distributions:

   Net-OpenID-Server -- implements an OpenID Provider
   Net-OpenID-Common -- prerequisite for both -Server and -Consumer

INSTALL has the usual installation instructions.  

Changes has the change log (surprise).

If you are upgrading from version 1.03 and earlier,
please be aware of API changes with respect to 

  $consumer->args(CODEREF)
  $consumer->handle_server_response / user_setup_url

see 'Changes' and the Consumer.pm podfile for details.
