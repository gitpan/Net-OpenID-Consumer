0.02:
	* POD docs for Net/OpenID/Consumer.pm

	* accepts CGI, Apache, Apache::Request, and CODE arguments now for
	GET argument retrievers, in addition to just HASH references

	* openid.server auto-discovery only happens within first <head> tag

	* if using Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA, now requires 0.12 due to bugs found
	  in 0.11.

	* DSA verification using OpenSSL binary no longer spews "Verification OK"
	  to stdout

0.01:
	* fetching of page (with configurable user agent object; I
	  recommend you use LWPx::ParanoidAgent, now available on CPAN)
	  and returning a "ClaimedIdentity" object of what the user claims
	  they are, but is not verified yet

	* auto-discovery of openid servers

	* hook to let you provide your subref to do openid server
	  selection, given multiple options

        * generation of "check" URL to send user to to get redirect

	* reading of response parameters, returning either a
	  user_setup_url or a VerifiedIdentity object (doing DSA
	  validation with either Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA or your openssl
	  binary)

	 * start of JSON responses for javascript UI
